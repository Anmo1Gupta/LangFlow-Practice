The document does not explicitly mention any key opportunities for the company. However, it outlines several risk factors that could impact Walmart's business and financial performance. These risks include unexpected changes in the company's objectives and plans, developments in legal and regulatory proceedings, changes in credit ratings, changes in the company's effective tax rate, and unanticipated changes in accounting judgments and estimates. Other risks include changes in existing tax, labor and other laws, changes in governmental policies, the imposition of new taxes on imports and new tariffs and trade restrictions, changes in currency control laws, changes in public assistance payments, the timing of federal income tax refunds, natural disasters, public health emergencies, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\n","\n","2. The document does not provide a description of the company's business outlook for the year. However, it does note that Walmart earns a disproportionate part of its annual operating income in the fourth quarter due to seasonal buying patterns. This could suggest that the company expects a significant portion of its income to be generated during the holiday season.\n","\n","Detailed Analysis for Risk Factors section in 2023 annual report:\n","\n","1. The document does not explicitly mention any key opportunities for the company. However, it does highlight several risks that Walmart faces. These include potential disruptions in the supply chain, changes in government regulations in various jurisdictions, failure to prioritize Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, challenges in attracting and retaining quality associates, failure to effectively execute its omni-channel strategy, inability to predict and respond to changing consumer trends, strong competition from other retailers and businesses, and adverse changes in economic conditions such as inflation, consumer disposable income, and general economic conditions.\n","\n","2. The document does not provide a description of the company's business outlook for the year 2023. The section provided is focused on the potential risks to the company's operations and financial performance, rather than its expectations or projections for the future.\n","\n","Additional Questions for Risk Factors in 2023 Annual Report:\n","\n","1. The most significant risks highlighted for Walmart in the 2023 annual report include disruptions in the supply chain, government regulations, failure to prioritize Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, challenges in human capital management, failure to execute strategic risks such as omni-channel strategy effectively, inability to predict and respond to changing consumer trends, competition from other retailers and businesses, and adverse economic conditions.\n","\n","2. Without information from previous years, it's impossible to make a direct comparison. However, typically, risks such as supply chain disruptions, government regulations, competition, and economic conditions are common for large multinational corporations like Walmart. Newer risks might include the emphasis on ESG priorities and the need to adapt to changing consumer trends, particularly in the context of the digital transformation and the increased importance of online shopping.\n","\n","3. The document does not provide specific strategies that Walmart is employing to mitigate these risks. However, based on the identified risks, potential strategies could include strengthening relationships with suppliers, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations, prioritizing ESG initiatives, investing in employee recruitment and retention, refining their omni-channel strategy, staying abreast of and responding to consumer trends, maintaining competitive pricing and product offerings, and closely monitoring economic conditions to make necessary adjustments.\n"]}],"source":["# Perform QA sequentially for 2018, 2023, and comparison\n","for year in [\"2018\", \"2023\"]:\n","    print(f\"\\nDetailed Analysis for Risk Factors section in {year} annual report:\\n\")\n","    question = {\n","        \"doc\": summarized_sections[year][\"Risk Factors\"],\n","        \"year\": year,\n","        \"section_name\": \"Risk Factors\"\n","    }\n","    print(qa_chain.invoke(question))\n","\n","    # Additional QA for 2023\n","    if year == \"2023\":\n","        print(\"\\nAdditional Questions for Risk Factors in 2023 Annual Report:\\n\")\n","        additional_question = {\n","            \"doc\": summarized_sections[year][\"Risk Factors\"],\n","            \"year\": year\n","        }\n","        print(additional_qa_chain.invoke(additional_question))\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":633,"status":"ok","timestamp":1734239153306,"user":{"displayName":"Rishaan 11","userId":"14765393542576738401"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"ZMQyYGiYocRz"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define comparison template\n","COMPARISON_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"\n","You are an assistant tasked with comparing two documents.

Therefore, there are no changes in business outlook and opportunities, risks identified by the firm, or the overall evolution of the firm’s priorities and strategies between the two sections. \n","\n","However, comparing the content within each section, we can observe the following:\n","\n","1. Business Outlook and Opportunities: \n","   - In 2018, Walmart emphasized the impact of seasonal buying patterns on its annual operating income, indicating a focus on maximizing sales during peak seasons.\n","   - By 2023, the company's focus seems to have shifted towards a more holistic approach, emphasizing the importance of its omni-channel strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce and technology, indicating a shift towards digital transformation.\n","\n","2. Risks Identified by the Firm:\n","   - In 2018, the risks identified were more general and included changes in company objectives, legal developments, changes in credit ratings, tax rates, accounting judgments, and external factors like natural disasters, public health emergencies, and terrorist attacks.\n","   - In 2023, the risks are more specific and directly related to the company's operations. These include disruptions in the supply chain, failure to prioritize ESG issues, inability to attract and retain quality associates, failure to execute the omni-channel strategy, inability to respond to changing consumer trends, competition, and adverse economic conditions.\n","\n","3. Evolution of the Firm’s Priorities and Strategies:\n","   - In 2018, the company's priorities seem to be more reactive, responding to changes in external factors.\n","   - By 2023, the company's priorities have evolved to be more proactive, focusing on strategic initiatives like ESG priorities, human capital management, and strategic risks related to their omni-channel strategy. This indicates a shift towards a more strategic and forward-thinking approach to managing the business.\n","\n","Comparison for MD&A section between 2018 and 2023:\n","\n","1. Changes in Business Outlook and Opportunities:\n","   - In the 2018 report, Walmart's operations were divided into three segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam's Club. The U.S. segment was the largest, contributing the most to the company's net sales and operating income. The International segment was growing through the expansion of retail, wholesale, and eCommerce units.\n","   - By 2023, the company had taken strategic actions to strengthen its portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment. These actions included the sale of Walmart Argentina, Asda, and Seiyu, the buyout of noncontrolling interest shareholders of its Massmart subsidiary, and increased ownership in PhonePe. This indicates a shift in focus towards strengthening and consolidating its international operations.\n","\n","2. Changes in the Risks Identified by the Firm:\n","   - The 2018 report does not explicitly mention any risks faced by the company.\n","   - In the 2023 report, the company discusses the impact of currency exchange rates on the company's operating results, indicating an increased awareness and concern about the potential risks associated with international operations and currency fluctuations. The report also highlights the competitive nature of the omni-channel retail industry, suggesting that competition has intensified over the years.\n","\n","3. Overall Evolution of the Firm’s Priorities and Strategies:\n","   - In 2018, the company's strategy seemed to be focused on expanding its operations, particularly in the international segment, and growing its eCommerce units.\n","   - By 2023, the company's strategy had evolved to include not just expansion, but also consolidation and strengthening of its portfolio. The company had taken strategic actions such as selling off certain international units and buying out noncontrolling interest shareholders of its subsidiaries. This suggests a shift in strategy towards optimizing its operations and focusing on profitable units. The company also seems to be paying more attention to the risks associated with international operations and competition in the omni-channel retail industry.\n"]}],"source":["# Perform comparison\n","comparison_chain = (\n","    {\n","        \"doc_1\": RunnablePassthrough(),\n","        \"doc_2\": RunnablePassthrough(),\n","        \"year_1\": RunnablePassthrough(),\n","        \"year_2\": RunnablePassthrough()\n","    }\n","    | comparison_prompt\n","    | llm\n","    | StrOutputParser()\n",")\n","\n","for section in [\"Risk Factors\", \"MD&A\"]:\n","    question = {\n","        \"doc_1\": summarized_sections[\"2018\"][section],\n","        \"doc_2\": summarized_sections[\"2023\"][section],\n","        \"year_1\": \"2018\",\n","        \"year_2\": \"2023\"\n","    }\n","    print(f\"\\nComparison for {section} section between 2018 and 2023:\\n\")\n","    print(comparison_chain.invoke(question))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNd3kF3tGVu5bWhyCB0xCUA","provenance":[{"file_id":"1FErHR-SqL_4VcUCXA-WL9hN-ZszbHyxE","timestamp":1734237125174}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
